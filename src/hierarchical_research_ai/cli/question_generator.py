Generate 2-3 targeted clarifying questions to improve research quality. Focus on:
1. Missing requirement categories
2. Ambiguous or unclear specifications
3. Important details that would affect research quality

Questions should be:
- Specific and actionable
- Relevant to the research domain
- Easy for the user to answer
- Focused on critical information gaps

Format each question on a new line, starting with a dash (-).
