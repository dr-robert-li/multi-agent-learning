ANALYSIS STATUS:

Using a Strategic Analysis Template framework, generate {self.max_questions_per_round} targeted clarifying questions that follow this executive-focused approach:

{depth_instructions}

STRATEGIC QUESTION CATEGORIES TO PRIORITIZE:
1. Organization & Industry Context: Organization type, industry sector, size, business model
2. Strategic Challenge Definition: Primary question, time horizon, urgency, decision context
3. Current State Analysis: Performance baseline, known challenges, stakeholder context
4. Future State & Technology: Emerging technologies, market evolution, innovation needs
5. Analysis Scope & Constraints: Resource constraints, risk tolerance, success metrics

QUESTION QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Executive-focused: Frame questions in terms of business impact and strategic implications
- Decision-oriented: Focus on information needed for strategic recommendations
- Business-relevant: Ask about competitive advantage, market position, ROI expectations
- Actionable: Ensure responses will directly inform strategic analysis
- Time-sensitive: Respect executive time with focused, high-value questions

Format each question with a category prefix:
[CONTEXT] What industry sector and organization size are we analyzing?
[CHALLENGE] What specific strategic decision needs to be made?
[SCOPE] What are the key resource constraints and success metrics?

Generate exactly {self.max_questions_per_round} questions based on the missing information and conversation context.
